WHAT IS QUEUE?
- Queue Interface maintains FIFO (First in First out)
- There is no queue class (we will discuss abt priortiyQueue class later), hence we use Linkedlist
- This interface is dedicated to storing all the elements where the order of the elements matter.
- For example, whenever we try to book a ticket, the tickets are sold on a first come first serve basis. Therefore, the person whose request arrives first into the queue gets the ticket. 
- there are various classes like PriorityQueue , ArrayDeque etc, but the most frequently used implementation of the queue interface is PriorityQueue.
- eg : Queue <T> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();

- Queue<Integer> queue = new Linkedlist<>();

  queue.add(100);
  queue.add(10);
  queue.adad(1);

  Sysout(queue.peek());
  - peek method will go to the queue data strcuture and it will peek(return) whos at the first of the data structure. ( in the above case, 100 wil be the output)\
  - he just peaks and see whos at the first method  

- Sysout (queue.poll());

  - poll will return the first value of the queue same as peek, but, poll will also remove that value from the queue.
