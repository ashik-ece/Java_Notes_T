STACK :

- Stack<Integer> = new Stack<>();

stack.add(100);
stack.add(10);
stack.add(1);

- Stack follows Last in First out (LIFO)


- Sysout(stack.peek());
  - Here peek prints(peeks) the last value, as that is the first element that is outed first.
- System.out.println(stack.pop());
  - pop method, deletes/removes the last element (LIFO).



- Whatever error / exception we have in our java, the messages / method names (which are the exception) are stored in stack data structure.
- whatever function calls its stores in java as stack.
