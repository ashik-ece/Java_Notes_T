My notes :

- Can a class implements multiple interface?
  - YES!, the only issue is that, we have to implement all the methods of both (or multiple) interfaces which are implemented.
  - A class can implement multiple interfaces.
  - Inheritance can happen between interaces (using 'Extends')

official notes provided by prof :

In this lecture we will learn:
Implementation of multiple interfaces
Inheritance in between interfaces
Method calling of an interface

#1
We can have a class implementing multiple interfaces.
 class B implemets A,X
 {
 }
(here, A and X are two different interfaces)
Implementation of all the methods that are present in those interfaces should be given in a class.
Inheritance is also valid in between interfaces.
Inheritance can be achieved in between interfaces by using the extend keyword.
Whenever you create a reference of an interface and create an object of a class, then you can only call those methods by that reference that are present in that interface of which the refernce is created.
Methods of another interface can be called by using another reference variable for that interface with the object of a class.

class - class - extends
