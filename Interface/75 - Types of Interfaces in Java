My notes :

- Three types -> a) Normal, b) Functional/SAM, c) Marker
- In interface, we can only declare methods.
- Normal interface - where we have multiple methods.
- SAM - Single Abstract method interface
- Marker Interface - An interface which doesnt have any methods, its blank 
    - We create marker interface so that we can update something to the complier. (serialization / deserialization)
    

Official notes proviedd by prof:

In this lecture we are discussing types of interface:
#1
types  of interface
1) Normal interface
2)functional interface /SAM 
3)Marker  interface

#2
i)Normal interface 
Normal interface contains two or more abstract method.
It can have any number of static and default methods and also even public methods of Object classes.
you can declare variable which are public static final by deault

ii)Functional Interface:
Functional Interface is an interface that has only pure one abstract method.
It can have any number of static and default methods and also even public methods of Object classes
e.g Runnable interface : It contains only  run()  method 

iii)
Marker Interface:
An interface that does not contain any methods, fields, Abstract Methods, and any Constants is Called a Marker interface.
Also, if an interface is empty, then it is known as Marker Interface.
The Serializable and the Cloneable interfaces are examples of Marker interfaces.
