MY NOTES:

- There are some things that are meant to be kept private (like my github password :p)
- same with java, if we want to keep any properties of a object private, we use the keyword private
- private keyword make the property (instance variable) to be accessible only within the class and makes it inaccessible outside of the class 
- NOTEE: EVERYTIME WE CREATE AN INSTANCE VARIABLE, MAKE IT PRIVATE (no one from outside of the class should be able to access it "Directly".)
- There is a indrirect way with which we can access private variable outside of class. it goes as follows:
    - We do it with the help of methods.
    - NOTE : We CAN access the private variable inside a method of a same class.
- we can access methods with objects just like how we can access instance variable with the help of objects. [eg : obj.method1()]
- We can asign the values of the private variables with the help of methods (setters) and we can retruve the values of the private variables with the help of methods (getters)
- basically we are binding our data with methods. the only way to access the data is through methods. so no one from the outside of the class can use it directly.



OFFICAL CLASS NOTES PROVIDED BY PROF:

In this lecture we are discussing:
1)What is encapsulation?
2)how to achieve encapsulation
3)Benefits of encapsulation
4)how to use private data?

#1
What is encapsulation?
= binding data with method to make your program secure is known as encapsulation.
Consider encapsulation as we have capsule and inside capsule everything inside a class is wrapped or encapsulated.
e.g
class A{ private int a;  
public void setA(int num){a=num;} 
public int getA(){return a;}
} 
//here you can see that we can bind data with method inside a curly braces, it seems look like a capsule inside everything is present.

#2
how to achieve encapsulation?
-- through access specifiers private,protected,public,default . We can achieve 
encapsulation.

#3
Benefit of encapsulation
 i)Helpful in to achieve abstraction 
 ii)for security point of view it is most beneficial.
 iii)you can maintain log file through method when you bind your data with method.

#4
how to use private data?
-- using setters and getters method we can set and get the value of variable.
-- private int num;
public int getNum( )
{
return num;
}

public void setNum(int num)
{
this.num=num;
}

 Note:
 Always make variable as private and method as public to achieve  security in program.
