MY NOTES:

- constructor will have the same name as class name
- constructor will never return anything ( so no need to mention any return type like void, string etc)
- constructor will be called automatically (we dont need to manually call constructor)
- constrcutor will be called everytime we create a new object.
- we can set default values to the object with the help of constructor
- even though the default value can be given while defining the instance variable itself, BUT, genrally as a rule of thumb, as a good habit of programmer,
whenever we want to perform any operation, always do that in a method.(dont do it open while defining). constructor is a method. These are the general standard.
- Two methods with same name and different parametrs is called method overloading.


OFFICAL CLASS NOTES PROVIDED BY PROF:

In this lecture we will see:
What are constructors in Java/
Properties and use of a constructor
Syntax of a constructor

#1
When you create an object then in the heap memory, it will just create a blank object.
If you do not assign values than the default values will be assigned like:
 0 for int,
 NULL for string
We can also define values at the time of the creation of an object by giving our default values.

#2
Properties of a constructor:
Constructor is almost similar to a method it has a name and it also has round brackets.
The change in the constructor with respect to the method is that in the constructor we do not specify the return type.
The name of a constructor must be the same as the class name.
There is no need to call a constructor. It gets called automatically at the time of the creation of an object.
At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
Constructors are called only once at the time of object creation. While method(s) can be called any number of times.

#3
Syntax of a constructor:
class human {
 public Human()
 {
  statements;
 }
}
