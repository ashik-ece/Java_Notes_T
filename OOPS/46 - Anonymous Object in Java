MY NOTES:

- Objects are created in heap
- reference variable pointing to the object is stored in stack

- just like how
  - int marks = 99; can be written as
    int marks;
    marks = 99;

- in the same way, object creation is also two steps
  - Class obj = new Class(); can be written as :
  
  - Class obj; // This is called Reference Creation. (This is where we are getting a reference variable)
    obj = new Class(); // Here we are creating the object, And assiging the value to Obj.

    - new Class(); -> This is where we create the object. [This is Object Creation, not the entire Class obj = new Class(); line].
    - And that object is called as Anonymous object, because that object doenst have a name (reference variable).
- The moment we put new Class(), In our heap memory, it will create an object, and it contains the methods and instance variable of the Class class.
- Anonymous objects doesnt have any refernce.
- When we use just new Class();, an object is created in heap, but since we dont have a reference varibale, we wont be able to use it in stack
- We can use Anonymous object to show values and methods of class, BUT, we can use Anonymous Object ONLY ONCE. WE CANNOT USE IT AGAIN(Because to use anon
object, we have to use new keyword, and it will create a new object in heap).
- Every time we say new, a new object will be created in heap.



OFFICAL CLASS NOTES PROVIDED BY PROF:

In this lecture we will learn:

Object creation in Java
Anonymous objects in Java
Difference between Simple objects and Anonymous objects


#1
In JVM, we have both stack memory and heap memory.
Object is created in the heap memory that contains  variable and methods, it also have some address.
A obj=new A();
  obj.show();
here, A is the classname.
         obj (reference variable) refers to the address say 101
    show() is a method that is called using reference variable obj.
Every time you call an object, it will call the constructor as well.
Object creation can be done in two ways:
 1. Declare an object  - creating a reference
 2. Creating an object  - and assigning the value to it
e,g.,  A obj;
  obj=new A();
 *new A() shows that you are creating an object.

Reference of an object is created in the stack.


#2 
Anonymous Objects:- 
Anonymous objects are simply created by using the new keyword.
It does not have any reference for an anonymous object.
e.g., new A();
A method can directly be called using this object.
  new A().show();
We can't use the same anonymous object again. It will be use only for one time.
