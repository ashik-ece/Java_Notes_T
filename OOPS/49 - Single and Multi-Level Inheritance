MY NOTES:

- If A inherits B , its single level inheritance.
- If A inherits B, and B inherits C (thereby A containing values of C), this is known as Multi-level or hierchial inhertance.
eg :
    - Lets say, 
        - Clac - add(),sub()
        - advCalc - multi(),div()
        - veryAdvCalc - pow()
    - Now :
        - if advCalc extends Calc,
        and if veryAdvCalc extends advCalc,
    - VeryAdv Calc will have methods of both Clac and advCalc (because advCalc extends Calc)
    - VeryAdv Calc takes feature from advCalc, and advCalc takes features from calc, so veryadv calc has feature from both advcalc and calc, this is multilevel

n this lecture we will learn:
Types of inheritance in Java
Single inheritance in Java
Multilevel inheritance in Java
Examples related to single and multilevel inheritance


Single Inheritance:-
In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. 
Only one parent class exists in single inheritance.
It is when there are only two classes.
e.g., 
Calc class inherits the properties of AdvCalc class.
Here, Calc - child class
     AdvCalc - parent class


Multi-level inheritance:-
In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class, and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes.
More than one parent class exists in multilevel inheritance.
It is when we have multiple layers in between the classes.
e.g.,
Calc class inherits the properties of AdvCalc and further AdvCalc inherits the properties of VeryAdvCalc.
Here, Calc - child class
     AdvCalc - parent class of Calc & child class of VeryAdvCalc
     VeryAdvCalc - parent class of both other classes
