MY NOTES:

- lets say, A is the parent class and B is the child class that extends the parent class.
- Lets say A has a method called as AMethod and B has a method called as BMethod.
- if we want to execute BMethod, it will work since BMethod is already in Class B.
- if we want to execute Amethod, it will work since A is inherited by B, so B can access all the methods of A.
  - NOTE: When we call a method, the java will search that method in its own class first, if not found, it will go to its parent class and search there.
- So single level and multi level inheritance works, but multiple inheritance doesnt work.
- In multiple inhertance, a child has two parent class.
- Lets say i want to run a method XYZ(), which is present in both the parent classes. so how the complier will choose which parent's method to call first.
- This creates ambuguity.  hence Java doesnt support multiple inheritance. 

OFFICAL NOTES PROVIDED BY PROF:


In this lecture we are discussing:
1)what is multiple inheritance?
2)Why Java does not support Multiple Inheritance?
3)What is ambiguity and not allowed in java?

#1
Multiple inheritance
If a particular class inheriting multiple class then this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritance.
like c++ language there are multiple inheritance like that :
class A
{ 
... .. ... 
};
class B
{
... .. ...
};
class C: public A,public B
{
... ... ...
}; 

But Java not allowed  we have alternate option for that is implementing multiple interface not we will discussing in upcoming lecture.
#2
why java not support multiple inheritance?
=Because of the Ambiguity problem, Java does not support multiple inheritances directly.

#3
Why it is ambiguous?
suppose we have some class A, B and c
class A
{ 
... .. ... 
show(){

}
};
class B
{
... .. ...
show(){

}
};
class  C extends A,B //assume for some instance java support multiple inheritence
{
... ... ...
show(); 
//here we get ambiguity since if we allowed multiple inheritance and same two property or method belong to class A and Class B 
//then how C class use show() method there is ambiguity of choice...
//thatâ€™s why java exclude the concept of multiple inheritance

};
