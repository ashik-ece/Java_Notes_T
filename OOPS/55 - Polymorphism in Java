MY NOTES:

- In Java, polymorphism refers to the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 
- it allows objects to behave differently based on their specific class type.
- Types of polymorphism
  - Compile time polymorphism - method Overloading 
        - Java doesnt support operator overloading.

  - Run time polymorphimsm - Method overriding and Virtual functions
    - run time polymorphism also known as Dynamic Method dispatch.

- Complite Time polym - early
- run time poly - late

OFFICAL NOTES PROVIDED BY PROF:

In this video we are talking about polymorphism
-- it is important concept of object oriented programming.
-- one word in poly which means  many and words morphism means behaviour.
-- the polymorphism means behaving one action differently in different situation in java. 

-- two types of polymorphism 
-- compile time polymorphism and Run time polymorphism
-- when you compile the file and you will know what things get executed this behaviour is knows as compile time polymorphism.
-- when behaviour decide at run time this is known as run time polymorphism.
-- add(int, int) , add(int, int, int) decided at compile time 
- class A extends B  -- A class  has add(int, int) and B has add(int,int ) out of this two we can decide which can execute at run time then this is called run time polymorphism example.
