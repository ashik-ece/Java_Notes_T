my notes :

- FINAL is a keyword which can be used in variable , method, class.

- Final Variable :

    - lets say we have int num = 8;. We can change the value to 9 in the next line, by num = 10. now the value of num is 10.
    - if we want to make a variable constant, we use the final keyword. eg : int final num = 10;. Now the value of num is 10 and is fixed and cant be changed.
    - in c++ we use const and in java we use final.
    - its always a good practice to make a constant varibale final.
    - final variable means simply making constants.

 - Final Class :
   = final keyword is used in a class, to stop other classes inheriting the final class.
   = NO class can be a subclass (or daughter class) of a final class.
   = so once we make our class final, we are basicaly stopping inheritance.

- Final method :
  = final keyword is used in a method, to prevent method overriding.
  = Once we use final on a method, that method cannot be overriden (or hidden)
  - cant overide final method in java.

offical notes provided by prof :

In this video we are talking about final keyword:

-- final keyword use with variable , methods and class
-- if make a variable final then variable become constant
final int a=5;
//you cannot reassign a value to a
-- final class 
class A{
public void show(){
System.out.println("In Calc show);
}

public void add(int a,int b){
    System.out.println(a+b);
}
}

Suppose someone want to extend your class , but we want to stop inheritance then we need to make final
-- if you make class final then no one can inherite your class
-- but you can use the final class by making object of final class

class A{
    public final void show(){
        System.out.print("IN A");
    }
}

class B extends A{
    // but you inherit class but you cannot override show() method  if your method is final
    //since show method is final
}

-- if you make method as final no one can override your method.
