WEB : collection of  Different documents (HTML, CSS, PHP, xml, JS, cloud etc) that can be distributed/shared among computers in the network called as web.
Internet : International + Network
HTTP : HyperText Transfer Protocol - the set of rules used for transfering data from one system to another (from one browser(cilent) to the server)
Protocol : A set of rules are implemented when some devices communicate with each other.
HyperText : Some text acting as a resouce for some other text/data (links)
Client : Our pc / host pc / browser
Server : Something (which may be a machine/application) which provides services to the client.
Network : Connecting different computers together, where each computer is called a Node.
HTTP Request : It is a Packet of information that one computer sends to another computer to communicate something. (to send data)
HTTP Response : It is the packet of information sent by Server to the client in response to an earlier request made by the client.

- HTTP is a protocol that clients and servers use on the web to communicate 

- For communicating between client and server we use the concept of HTTP Request and HTTP response.
- server is providing services to the client and client is accepting services from the server.

Client - Server Architecture.
 -eg : 1o computers connected in a network and 1 printer, here the computers are client and printer is server, as it is providing printing services to the client.
 - when we enter any url in the browser (google.com) and press enter, our browser becomes the client, and an HTTP request object is created , and sent to the server, it gets processed in the server 
   and it connects with the database and gives the HTTP Response back to the client.

- A Web application is a request response application or a client seriver application.
- The combination of request and response is what we call it as WEB TRANSACTION.

- HTTP protocol has certain methods we can work with : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
  - whenever we want send data to the server, we use the POST request
  - whenever we want to fetch data from the server, we use GET request.

- in servelt, unless me metion the method, it takes the default method as GET
- POST will not put our data in the url, whereas GET puts on data in the url

Difference between GET and POST

- HTTP GET :
    - Data is sent in header
    - limited data is sent
    - not secured
    - can be bookmarked
    - Data is sent as a query String along with the URL itself the data will be sent. 
- HTTP POST:
    - Data is sent in request body
    - Large amount of data is sent
    - It is secured
    - Cannot be bookmarked.
    - The Data is sent along with HTTP request Object.
