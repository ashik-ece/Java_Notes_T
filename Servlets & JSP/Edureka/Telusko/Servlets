SERVLETS : 

What is a Servlet?
A servlet is a Java class that handles HTTP requests and responses.
It runs on a web server (like Apache Tomcat) and is used to create dynamic web content. 
Servlets extend the HttpServlet class, which provides methods to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).


How a Servlet Works:
Receives Request: The servlet receives an HTTP request from the client (e.g., a web browser). The client sends the request to the server, and the server forwards it to the appropriate servlet.

Processes Request: The servlet processes the request (e.g., retrieves data from a database, performs calculations, etc.).

Sends Response: The servlet sends an HTTP response back to the client (e.g., HTML, JSON, etc.).

Key Points:
The client (e.g., a browser) sends the HTTP request to the server.

The server forwards the request to the servlet.

The servlet processes the request and sends a response back to the client via the server.


Servlet Request Flow:

Client Sends Request:

        The client (e.g., a web browser) sends an HTTP request (e.g., GET or POST) to the web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).

Server Receives Request:

        The web server receives the HTTP request from the client.

Server Forwards Request to Servlet:

        The web server determines which servlet should handle the request based on the URL mapping (defined in web.xml or annotations).

        The server then forwards the request to the appropriate servlet.

Servlet Processes Request:

        The servlet receives the request from the server.

It processes the request (e.g., reads parameters, interacts with a database, etc.).

        It generates a response (e.g., HTML, JSON, etc.).

Servlet Sends Response to Server:

        The servlet sends the response back to the server.

Server Sends Response to Client:
        The server sends the response back to the client

Key Points:
The servlet does not directly communicate with the client. It only interacts with the server.

The server acts as an intermediary between the client and the servlet.

The servlet receives the request from the server, processes it, and sends the response back to the server, which then forwards it to the client.





- How to create servlet :
        - its a normal class which extends HttpServlet (this httpServlet will provide us all the features that we need)
            - features as in : 
                - takes request from the client
                - processing the request
                - sending the response




MY NOTES :

when the client sends the request to the server, expecting a page, which can be static or dynamic.
