- send redirect method belongs to response object.
- res.sendRedirect("S2"); // this willl redirect from where it is called(S1) to where its mentioned in the parameter(S2)
- in requestdispatcher, the request comes from S1 (add in this case)
- whereas in send redirect, the request comes from S2 (sq in this case)

- so the client is sending two request, add request and Sq request (S1 and S2 )


HOW TO SEND DATA IN SEND REDIRECT:

- in the S1, we mention 
  - res.sendRedirect("sq?K: " + k) // whatever we send inside this sendRedirect will be in the URL
- in the S2, we mention
  - int k = Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter("k"));


- we are able to do this by Session Management
