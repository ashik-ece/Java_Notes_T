- we use these two things to get the initial value for servlet or for the application
- usallly we specify extra information in the web.xml file which we can use while coding servlets.
- in the context param, we can specify through param name,value pair.
- lets say if i want to specify my name and the phone im using, the way i can do that is: 
    - in the web.xml, we will use a tag called as 
      <context-param>
      <param-name> name </param-name>
      <param-value> Ashik </param-value>
      </context-param>

      <context-param>
      <param-name> Phone </param-name>
      <param-value> Samsung </param-value>
      </context-param>

NOW HOW WILL WE USE IT?
- Now to fetch the value of the name or phone, we need to use a special object, 
- We have to create an object of Servlet Context.
  - In the Servlet.java file, inside the doGet method :
      - PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.print("HI ");

        ServletContext ctx = getServletContext();
        String str = ctx.getInitParameter("name");
        String str1 = ctx.getInitParameter("Phone");
        out.println(str);

- Servlet Context and Servlet Config both are Interfaces
- we dont need to instanstiate object, tomcat will take care of it, and give us an object, to access the object
  There are multiple ways :
    - we use getServletContext(); // we are getting this method from HttpServlet
    - request.getServletContext();

- getInitParameter() is a method which will give us the value of the attribute(param-name) which we specify.
    - eg: if we specify name there, it will give us the value of the name.

- ServletContext is an Object which will be shared by all the servlets. which means, if we specify the param-name&value in the web.xml, it will be shared by all the Servlets.
- What if we want different configuration/values for different Servlets.
  - eg: when i say name, Some a specific servlet i need it to be Naveen instead of AShik, and the way to do that, is in the servlet tag itself.
    because, Servlet Config works with the particular Servlet tag itself.
  - So if we have 5 servlets, in total we will get 5 Servlet config objects and only one genral Servlet Context object which is shared by all the servlets.

- Servlet Config Impl:

  - in the web.xml, in the Servlet tag (for the specific servlet which we want to specify)
        - <servlet>
         <init-param>
        <param-name> name </param-name>
        <param-value> Naveen </param-value>
        </init-param>
        </servlet>
    - after specifying in web.xml, go to that specific servlet and :
      - ServletConfig cg = getServletConfig();
        String str = cg.getInitParameter("name");
        out.println(str);
- Even if we have ServletContext param-name mentioned as Ashik, since we mentioned in the particular Servlet name as Naveen, when we use Servlet config for that particular Servlet
  it will take the value of Servlet config over Servlet Context
- So Servlet config is to set values for a specific servlet(mentioned in the servlet tag itself, and ServletContext is common to all the Servlets,
